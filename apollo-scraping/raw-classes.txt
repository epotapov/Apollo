Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering,\nas evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smartphones. In fact,\nbreakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus, it is\nparamount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus\non the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and, ultimately, failure\nmechanisms. Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the\ncontext of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect\nformation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elasto-\nplastic properties at the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels and their use in explaining the\ndeformation and failure characteristics in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in\ncomposites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys, ceramic-matrix composites, and fiber-\nreinforced polymer composites.

Yet, advances in materials have\nstagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material\nmodeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the\nintersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are\ndefined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on\nrelating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem\nand its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and\nmathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria;\nDrucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third,\ncrystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials,\nwith a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals.\nLastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the\nanisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals,\npolymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain\nhardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but\nfewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have\nbeen sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress\nhas made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more\nof an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas\nof study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic\nunderstanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that\ntechnology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College\nof Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many\ntopics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better\nquestions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?\nWhat impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people?\nWhat is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the\nmouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially\nbiofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.

This problem is further complicated by the fact that there are often ambiguities\nin the written law that lead to significant differences between what the law appears to say and how the law is\ninterpreted in the courts. This course is designed to give the student an understanding of both legal and economic\nprinciples and the relationship between them.

    "CreditHours": 2.0,
    "Description": "or 3.00. This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients\nand firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly\nworking with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to\ndiversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context.[1] For example, women represent over half of\nthe labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying\ntechnical and professional fields (Kossek & Buzzanell, 2018)[3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-\nrepresented . The U. S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic\nminorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic- American (18.3%), Asian-\nAmerican (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60% ) as well as a growing\nnumber of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U. S. Bureau of Census, 2019)[4]. Further,\n26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U. S. Bureau of Census,\n2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious\ngroup members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter Day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual\ndisabilities, immigrants, & LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, & Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively,\nthese differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community\neconomic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these\ndifferences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life wellbeing, and\nproductivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual\nemployee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-\nlevel approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your\nability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to\nfoster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced\norganizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the\nskills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or\ncollaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate\nmultiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle\nthe question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state of the art evidence-\nbased knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we\nfocus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping,\nidentity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander\nawareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one\nanother. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work\npublic and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity\nboundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the questions: \"What are best\npractices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and\ncultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive\nculture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster\ninnovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup,\norganizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate\nand barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many\nidentities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.Credits: 2.00 or 3.00"

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we\nneed to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course\nfocuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it\nfailed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China,\nthis failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of\nshame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of\nglobalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy\ninto the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st\ncentury will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.Credits: 3.00"

Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and\nPsychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not\nhad the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with\nthe background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral\nresearch. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor\nwill fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are\nchromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How\nare single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or\nabnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do\nthese studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of\nbehavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic\nprimate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and\nepigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these\nchanges may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles\nthese questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness.\nHowever, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can"

    "Description": "Orthopaedic tissues, such as bone, cartilage, tendon and ligament, serve functions that are largely\nmechanical in nature and that are critical for our health. This course is structured around classical topics in mechanics\nof materials and their applications in biomechanics and musculoskeletal tissues. Primary emphasis will be on the\nmechanical behavior of tissues, including elastic and failure properties as well as more advanced topics such as\nanisotropy, nonlinearity, viscoelasticity, poroelasticity, damage, and fatigue. Importantly, the theories used to describe\nthese mechanical properties were originally developed for advanced engineering materials such as fiber composites,\npolymers, elastomers, hydrogels, etc. Thus, while the theories will be presented in the context of biological materials,\npotential applications are much broader. Tissue microstructure and its importance to the material properties will be\ncovered. Mechanics of whole bones and implants (composite and asymmetric beam theories) and the mechanical\nfunction of native and artificial joints (contact mechanics, lubrication and wear) may also be discussed, time permitting.\nSome homework assignments will emphasize the use of experimental data to develop and test theoretical models via\nnonlinear curve fitting and optimization using Matlab. Students will receive an introduction to tissue mechanics\nliterature to better understand how the concepts presented in class are used in the research setting. Credits: 3.00"
